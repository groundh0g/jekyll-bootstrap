## Static Assets

Static assets are any file in the root or non-underscored subfolders that are not pages.
That is they have no valid YAML Front Matter and are thus not treated as Jekyll Pages.

Static assets should be used for images, css, and javascript files.




## How Jekyll Parses Files

Remember Jekyll is a processing engine. There are two main types of parsing in Jekyll.

- **Content parsing.**
	This is done with textile or markdown.
- **Template parsing.**
  This is done with the liquid templating language.

And thus there are two main types of file formats needed for this parsing.

- **Post and Page files.**
  All content in Jekyll is either a post or a page so valid posts and pages are parsed with markdown or textile.
- **Template files.**
	These files go in `_layouts` folder and contain your blogs **templates**. They should be made in HTML with the help of Liquid syntax.
	Since include files are simply injected into templates they are essentially parsed as if they were native to the template.

**Arbitrary files and folders.**
Files that _are not_ valid pages are treated as static content and pass through
Jekyll untouched and reside on your blog in the exact structure and format they originally existed in.

### Formatting Files for Parsing.

We've outlined the need for valid formatting using **YAML Front Matter**.
Templates, posts, and pages all need to provide valid YAML Front Matter even if the Matter is empty.
This is the only way Jekyll knows you want the file processed.

YAML Front Matter must be prepended to the top of template/post/page files:

    ---
    layout: post
    category : pages
    tags : [how-to, jekyll]
    ---

    ... contents ...

Three hyphens on a new line start the Front-Matter block and three hyphens on a new line end the block.
The data inside the block must be valid YAML.

Configuration parameters for YAML Front-Matter is outlined here:
[A comprehensive explanation of YAML Front Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter)

#### Defining Layouts for Posts and Templates Parsing.

The `layout` parameter in the YAML Front Matter defines the template file for which the given post or template should be injected into.
If a template file specifies its own layout, it is effectively being used as a `sub-template.`
That is to say loading a post file into a template file that refers to another template file with work in the way you'd expect; as a nested sub-template.





## How Jekyll Generates the Final Static Files.

Ultimately, Jekyll's job is to generate a static representation of your website.
The following is an outline of how that's done:

1. **Jekyll collects data.**
  Jekyll scans the posts directory and collects all posts files as post objects. It then scans the layout assets and collects those and finally scans other directories in search of pages.

2. **Jekyll computes data.**
  Jekyll takes these objects, computes metadata (permalinks, tags, categories, titles, dates) from them and constructs one
  big `site` object that holds all the posts, pages, layouts, and respective metadata.
  At this stage your site is one big computed ruby object.

3. **Jekyll liquifies posts and templates.**
  Next jekyll loops through each post file and converts (through markdown or textile) and **liquifies** the post inside of its respective layout(s).
  Once the post is parsed and liquified inside the the proper layout structure, the layout itself is "liquified".
	**Liquification** is defined as follows: Jekyll initiates a Liquid template, and passes a simpler hash representation of the ruby site object as well as a simpler
  hash representation of the ruby post object. These simplified data structures are what you have access to in the templates.

3. **Jekyll generates output.**
	Finally the liquid templates are "rendered", thereby processing any liquid syntax provided in the templates
	and saving the final, static representation of the file.

**Notes.**
Because Jekyll computes the entire site in one fell swoop, each template is given access to
a global `site` hash that contains useful data. It is this data that you'll iterate through and format
using the Liquid tags and filters in order to render it onto a given page.

Remember, in Jekyll you are an end-user. Your API has only two components:

1. The manner in which you setup your directory.
2. The liquid syntax and variables passed into the liquid templates.

All the data objects available to you in the templates via Liquid are outlined in the **API Section** of Jekyll-Bootstrap.
You can also read the original documentation here: <https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data>

## Conclusion

I hope this paints a clearer picture of what Jekyll is doing and why it works the way it does.
As noted, our main programming constraint is the fact that our API is limited to what is accessible via Liquid and Liquid only.

Jekyll-bootstrap is intended to provide helper methods and strategies aimed at making it more intuitive and easier to work with Jekyll =)
